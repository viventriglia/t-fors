# T-FORS
Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances Forecasting System (funded by the European Community, Horizon Europe)

## What is that?
We aim at the development of a machine-learning-based algorithm to forecast **Large Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances**. The work is carried out within the ["T-FORS - Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances Forecasting System"](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101081835) project.

## How can I run it?

First, you need to install dependencies via [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) with

- `poetry install`

If you are on Windows, to launch a web server and execute jupyter notebooks, you can run the `scripts/run-jupyter.ps1` script.
Otherwise, you can activate the virtual environment manually and then execute the `poetry run jupyter notebook` command.

[WIP] Launch the web app

- `streamlit run 0_üè†_Home.py`
